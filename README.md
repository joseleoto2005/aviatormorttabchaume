### Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

Now that you've installed the **Aviator game app**, let's walk through
the basic gameplay so you can get started.

#### Step 1: Create an Account

Before you can play the game, you need to create an account on the
casino platform of your choice. This process typically requires entering
basic details such as your name, email, phone number, and setting a
secure password.

#### Step 2: Fund Your Account

After registration, you'll need to deposit funds into your casino
account. Choose from a variety of payment methods such as credit/debit
cards, UPI, e-wallets, or cryptocurrencies (depending on the casino).

Once your account is funded, navigate to the **Aviator game** section.
The game's interface will allow you to select your bet size before each
round. You can adjust the bet based on your preferences.

#### Step 4: Start Playing
